## Mobile Cordova Samples

### Structure

Everything related to building the views and controllers of our SDK, and Cordova in general, is located under `www/`. 

CARTO MapView initialization and usage is under `www/js/index.js/`

This sample contains **2** Cordova plugins

* com.carto.plugin.sdk 0.0.1 "CartoMobileSDK"
* cordova-plugin-device 1.1.5-dev "Device"

### Setup

* `cordova restore` – Platforms and plugins are automatically restored from config.xml when the 'cordova prepare' command is run.
* `cordova run android` & `cordova run ios` – automatically locates an available device and runs the app (prefers real device to emulator/simulator)
